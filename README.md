## Hello there! 🐱‍💻

As a junior frontend web developer with a background in cultural anthropology and video production, I bring a unique perspective to coding.<br/>
I thrive on problem-solving and constantly seek new techniques to enhance my work.
My goal is to create visually appealing and intuitively usable applications that prioritize accessibility for all users. 

Don't hesitate to get in touch!
